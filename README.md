# reducible_space_model

Update: instructions & clean-up still in progress - completion date will be 29/03/23

Step 1: download python and install jupyter lab
> This is by far the most tedious step and can take hours to troubleshoot when you're just getting started. There is no science to making it work, just persistence and google.
> This video is a good place to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoDIwe1_YM&t=24s
> When things don't work, it's usually an issue with the system's environment variables and/or the file path; it can help to try uninstalling/reinstalling either python or jupyter lab and trying a few different approaches.

Step 2: install pandas using 'pip install pandas' in the command prompt
> This should be the only other package that might need installing to run the program

Step 3:

Notes from Justine:
- change the school # variable easily to replicate for other schools
- does it conclude if space is excess and why? e.g. where under/over across spaces classifications, it aggregates and providers a "decision" re if there is space or not? ANy suggest what discrete spaces are recommended for removal/reducibility?
- how do we copy this workspace to own GitHub accounts?
- Is it reliant on local drive info you hold?
- Can the input file be easily changed and what is the base data and instructions on how to download, upload, update?


If you can add to the outputs an explanation of syntax, logic how they work together e.g. what the syntax does outside the context of your code, and how the same syntax solves aÂ specific problem.
Context, syntax and logic are the pillers of programs. To explain you need to understand all three and how they solve problems.
