# reducible_space_model

Also, I may be missing the point, can you:
- change the school # variable easily to replicate for other schools
- does it conclude if space is excess and why? e.g. where under/over across spaces classifications, it aggregates and providers a "decision" re if there is space or not? ANy suggest what discrete spaces are recommended for removal/reducibility?
- how do we copy this workspace to own GitHub accounts?
- Is it reliant on local drive info you hold?
- Can the input file be easily changed and what is the base data and instructions on how to download, upload, update?

Notes from Justine:
If you can add to the outputs an explanation of syntax, logic how they work together e.g. what the syntax does outside the context of your code, and how the same syntax solves aÂ specific problem.
Context, syntax and logic are the pillers of programs. To explain you need to understand all three and how they solve problems.
